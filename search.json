    "text": "Project Description\nSurvival analysis is the set of statistical methods used to analyze time-to-event data, also known as failure time analysis or time-to-event analysis. The main question in survival analysis is what proportion of the population will survive to a given time if a certain event does not occur. The most important results of the analysis are survival curve and hazard curve.\nNon-parametric analysis does not assume a specific form for survival or hazard functions. It uses data to estimate these functions.\nA survival curve is a graphical representation of the probability that the subject of interest will not experience an event (failure or illness) within a specified period of time. The Kaplan-Meier estimate is used to model the survival function and cumulative incidence function.\nCumulative incidence (e.i. failure probability) is calculated as the number of new events (failures or cases of disease) divided by the total number of members of the population at risk during a given time.\nThe cumulative hazard function provides the total accumulated risk of experiencing the event of interest (failure or disease) gained by progressing to time t. The cumulative hazard can be estimated nonparametrically by the Nelson-Aalen estimators.\nThe main areas of application for survival analysis are the analysis of bio-medical data and the analysis of engineering reliability. This project shows simple survival analysis in engineering and medical applications.\n\n\nPackages used in the program\n\nif (!require(survival)) {install.packages('survival', \n                  repos=\"http://cran.us.r-project.org\"); require(survival)}\nif (!require(survminer)) {install.packages('survminer',\n                  repos=\"http://cran.us.r-project.org\"); require(survminer)}\nif (!require(gtsummary)) {install.packages('gtsummary', \n                  repos=\"http://cran.us.r-project.org\"); require(gtsummary)}\n\n\n\nEngineering reliability analysis\n\nInput data\nThe ‘imotor’ dataset (Table 1) shows a breakdown of motor insulation as a function of temperature.\nTerms:\n\ntemp: temperature of the test,\ntime: time to failure or censoring,\nstatus: 0=censored, 1=failed.\n\nThe main objective of the analysis is to determine what is the probability that the motor insulation will not fail by a certain time. The result of the analysis can also be presented as probability of failure (cumulative incidence) or the risk of an event occurring up to time t (the cumulative hazard).\n\ndata(reliability, package=\"survival\")\nknitr::kable(\n imotor[1:7, 1:3]\n)\n\n\n\nTable 1: Excerpt from the ‘imotor’ dataset (package ‘survival’)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntemp\ntime\nstatus\n\n\n\n\n150\n8064\n0\n\n\n150\n8064\n0\n\n\n150\n8064\n0\n\n\n150\n8064\n0\n\n\n150\n8064\n0\n\n\n150\n8064\n0\n\n\n150\n8064\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvival object summary and median survival (95 % CI)\nThe median survival is the amount of time to which probability that the members of the group have not experienced an event is 50%.\n95 % CI means 95% confidence interval.\nResults of calculations are shown below and in Figures 1,2,3.\n\n\n  records     n.max   n.start    events     rmean se(rmean)    median   0.95LCL   0.95UCL \n   40.000    40.000    40.000    17.000  4995.173   551.206  5196.000  3444.000        NA \n\n\n   The median survival is  5196\n\n\n   The lower bound of 95% confidence interval is  3444\n\n\n   The upper bound of 95% confidence interval is  unknown\n\n\n\n\nSurvival curve and number of objects at risk\nThe median survival can be seen in Fig.1.\n\nggsurvplot(fit, \n           conf.int = TRUE,\n           risk.table = TRUE, \n           risk.table.col = 1, \n           risk.table.y.text.col = TRUE,\n           linetype = 1, \n           surv.median.line = \"hv\", \n           ggtheme = theme_bw(), \n           palette = \"#2E9FDF\",\n           risk.table.height=.25,\n           legend = \"none\",\n          )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Survival curve with 95% CI, median survival and number at risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative incidence curve\n\nggsurvplot(fit, conf.int = TRUE,\n           palette = \"#FF9E29\",\n           risk.table = F, \n           risk.table.col = 1,\n           ggtheme = theme_bw(), \n           xlab = \"Time\",\n           ylab = \"Cumulative incidence\",\n           fun = \"event\",\n           legend = \"none\",\n           ) \n\n\n\n\nCumulative incidence curve and 95% CI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCumulative hazard curve\n\nggsurvplot(fit, conf.int = TRUE, \n           ggtheme = theme_bw(), \n           palette = \"dodgerblue4\",\n           risk.table = F,\n           risk.table.col = 1,\n           fun = \"cumhaz\",\n           legend = \"none\"\n           )\n\n\n\n\nCumulative hazard curve and 95% CI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvival analysis of medical data\n\nInput data\nThe ‘diabetic’ base shown in Table 2 is the data set of 197 patients with “high-risk” diabetic retinopathy.
